	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
	This is a slavic site or site about slavs, their culture, spirit, tradition, history and so on.. Well i made this site because i am a pan-slavist. Pan-slavism is
	not a nationalism. It is a political ideology concerned with the advancement of integrity and unity for the Slavic-speaking peoples. Slavic intellectuals and scholars in 
	the developing fields of history, philology, and folklore actively encouraged 
	the passion of their shared identity and ancestry. Pan-Slavism also co-existed with the Southern Slavic independence.</br>
	Commonly used symbols of the Pan-Slavic movement were the Pan-Slavic colours (blue, white and red) and the Pan-Slavic anthem, Hey, Slavs.
	The first pan-Slavists were the 16th-century Croatian writer Vinko Pribojević and the 17th-century Aleksandar Komulović, Bartol Kašić, Ivan Gundulić
	and Croatian Catholic missionary Juraj Križanić. Some of the earliest manifestations of Pan-Slavic thought within the Habsburg Monarchy have been 
	attributed to Adam Franz Kollár and Pavel Jozef Šafárik.</br> The First Pan-Slav congress was held in Prague, Bohemia in June, 1848, during the revolutionary movement of 1848. 
	The Czechs had refused to send representatives 
	to the Frankfurt Assembly feeling that Slavs had a distinct interest from the Germans. The Austroslav, František Palacký, presided over the event. Most of the delegates
	were Czech and Slovak. Palacký called for the co-operation of the Habsburgs and had also endorsed the Habsburg monarchy as the political formation most likely to protect 
	the peoples of central Europe. When the Germans asked him to declare himself in favour of their desire for national unity, he replied that he would not as this
	would weaken the Habsburg state: “Truly, if it were not that Austria had long existed, it would be necessary, in the interest of Europe, in the interest of 
	humanity itself, to create it.” </br> The Pan-Slav congress met during the revolutionary turmoil of 1848. Young inhabitants of Prague had taken to the streets and in
	the confrontation, a stray bullet had killed the wife of Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince
	of Windisch-Grätz, the commander of the Austrian forces in Prague. Enraged, Windischgrätz seized the city, disbanded the congress, and established 
	martial law throughout Bohemia.</br>
	Pan-Slavism in the south would often turn to Russia for support. The Southern Slavic movement advocated the independence of the Slavic peoples in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, 
	Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. Some Serbian intellectuals sought to unite all of the Southern, Balkan Slavs, whether Catholic (Croats, Slovenes),
	Muslim (Bosniaks), or Orthodox (Serbs, Montenegrins, Bulgarians) as a "Southern-Slavic nation of three faiths".</br>
	Austria feared that Pan-Slavists would endanger the empire. In Austria-Hungary Southern Slavs were distributed among several entities: Slovenes in 
	the Austrian part (Carniola, Styria, Carinthia, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste, Istria (also Croats), Croats and Serbs in the Hungarian part within 
	the autonomous Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and in the Austrian part within the autonomous Kingdom of Dalmatia, and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, under direct 
	control from Vienna. Due to a different position within Austria-Hungary several different goals were prominent among the Southern Slavs of Austria-Hungary. 
	A strong alternative to Pan-Slavism was Austroslavism, especially among the Croats and Slovenes. Because the Serbs were dispersed among several regions, 
	and the fact that they had ties to the independent nation state of Kingdom of Serbia, they were among the strongest supporters of independence of South-Slavs
	from Austria-Hungary and uniting into a common state under Serbian monarchy.</br>
	After World War I the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, under Serbian royalty of the Karađorđević dynasty, united most Southern Slavic-speaking 
	nations regardless of religion and cultural background. The only ones they did not unite with were the Bulgarians. Still, in the years after the Second World War,
	there were proposals to incorporate Bulgaria into a Greater Yugoslavia thus uniting all south Slavic-speaking nations into one state. The idea was abandoned 
	after the split between Josip Broz Tito and Joseph Stalin in 1948. This led to some bitter sentiment between the people of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the aftermath.</br>
	At the end of Second World War, the Partisans leader Josip Broz Tito, a Croat, became Yugoslav president, and the country become a socialist republic.
	Tito advocated Brotherhood and unity which meant equality among the ethnic groups, including non-Slav minorities. This led to relatively peaceful
	co-existence and prosperity until the breakup of the federation.</br>
	Pan-Slavism is also popular in Poland and Russia.</br>
