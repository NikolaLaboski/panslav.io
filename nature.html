	<img src="rila.jpg" style="width:100%">

	  being an important historic and cultural monument, the Eastern Orthodox Rila Monastery is an architectural icon. Labelled as the Jerusalem of Bulgaria, 
	  it is the biggest monastery in the country and is home to compelling religious iconography, including wall paintings, carvings and historical artifacts.
	  The ancient monastery is still active and is home to around 60 monks who still live and work in the tranquil peace of the monastery inside 
	  its ornate buildings. The striking stripes of the exterior and gently curved arches, along with the crowning domes, set the monastery apart 
	  from the surrounding tree-covered mountainous landscape.

    <img src="pirin.jpg" style="width:100%">
	  <p>Home to more than 70 glacial lakes, old forests and soaring 2,915-metre peaks and ridges, the Pirin National Park

	  Large animals still roam the slopes, from brown bears and wild boar to gray wolves and jackals; this is a remote and wild area that is under threat from 
	  development by ski resorts.Spend your time visiting the unimaginably beautiful park by hiking the numerous paths, cycling among the alpine meadows or fishing 
	  alongside waterfalls. You can even stay overnight in Pirin’s huts, and find the famous Baykuchevata Macedonian pine tree that is said to be approximately 1,350 years old!

      the many intricate mosaics, meaningful murals and depictions of saints and angels; huge chandeliers hang low, dripping in decadent gold, 
      whilst the solid wood of the altar and pews is delicately carved.
