	<h1 style="font-family:DejaVu Sans Mono, monospace;">Ajvar</h1>
    <img src="ajvar1.jpg" style="width:100%" height="auto">
	<p>Ajvar is made of roasted or cooked peppers. Depending on the capsaicin content in bell peppers and the amount of added chili peppers,
	it can be sweet (traditional), piquant (the most common), or very hot (ljutenica). Ajvar can be consumed as a bread spread or as a side dish.
	There are few variations of ajvar. If it contains tomato, then it is called pindjur or if it contains eggplant is called malidzano.
	The name ajvar comes from the Turkish word havyar, which means "salted roe, caviar" shares an etymology with "caviar".
	Ajvar is produced in various countries, including Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia. Serbia's reported annual production is 640 tons.
	Ajvar is one of the so-called zimnica (winter foods), which include pickled chili peppers, pickled tomatoes, and anything else that can 
	be preserved in a jar just before winter.</b>
	</br>
	Ingredients</br>
	</br>
	2 large eggplants about 3 pounds</br>
	6 large red bell peppers</br>
	Salt and black pepper</br>
	1 garlic clove finely chopped</br>
	Juice of 1 lemon</br>
	1/2 cup good-quality olive oil</br>
	1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley</br>
	Select all ingredients</br>
	Directions</br> 
	Heat oven to 475 degrees. Place washed eggplants and peppers on a baking sheet with a lip to catch any juices, and roast until their skins blister and turn black,
	about 30 minutes.
	Place roasted vegetables in a heatproof bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let them steam for 10 minutes.
	Peel off and discard blackened skins, stems and seeds. In a large bowl, mash or chop vegetables, depending on how smooth or chunky you like your ajvar.

	<h1 style="font-family:DejaVu Sans Mono, monospace;">Stuffed peppers</h1>
    <img src="polne.jpg" style="width:100%" height="auto">
	<p>“Polneti Piperki” – or stuffed peppers – are very popular in Macedonia.  There are many versions of this recipe, 
	passed down from Baba or from friend to friend.Stuffed peppers is a dish that exists in different names and forms around the world.
	It consists of hollowed or halved peppers (typically bell peppers), 
	filled with any of a variety of fillings, often including meat, vegetables, cheese, rice, or sauce. They are usually assembled by filling the cavities
	of the peppers and then cooking.</br>
	 Ingredients</br>
	</br>
	FOR THE PEPPERS</br>
	8 large red bell pepper </br>
	1 large ripe heirloom tomatoes </br>
	1 large yellow onion </br>
	3 Tbsp olive oil</br>
	100 g proscuitto </br>
	1 1/2 lb ground turkey </br>
	3 cloves garlic </br>
	1 cup dry barley </br>
	1 tbsp smoked paprika</br>
	large handful fresh basil </br>
	to taste salt and pepper</br>
	3 medium Potatoes </br>
	</br>
	FOR THE PAPRIKA SAUCE</br>
	2 Tbsp olive oil</br>
	2 Tbsp flour</br>
	2 tsp smoked paprika</br>
	2 cups water</br>
	1 large ripe heirloom tomatoes </br>
	to taste salt and pepper</br>
	</br>
	Directions</br>
	Heat a large frying pan over low-medium heat. Add oil then onions and a sprinkling of salt. Saute until softened, 4-5 minutes.
	Add the garlic and cook for a minute.</br>
	</br>
	Turn heat up slightly to medium and add the chopped proscuitto. Cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.</br>
	Add ground turkey (or whichever ground meat you're using) and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring continuously to brown on all sides.</br>
	</br>
	Stir in the cooked barley (or rice). Add paprika and mix through; once fragrant (1-2 minutes) add chopped blanched* tomato and stir.
	Remove from heat and stir in the basil, salt and pepper.
	</br>
	*This means that you have boiled the tomato just long enough to remove the skin.
	</br>
	Preheat oven to 450 F. Cut off the top of the pepper, close to the stem but leaving the stem in tact. Remove the core and all seeds.
	Fill each pepper with the meat mixture, gently pushing to the sides so that the filling is evenly distributed; repeat this process until each pepper is full.
	Return the top to each pepper.
	</br>
	Place peppers upright in a large casserole dish. Evenly arrange the potato chunks (if using) around the peppers.
	</br>
	FOR THE PAPRIKA SAUCE</br>
	To make the sauce heat olive oil in a sauce pan over medium heat. Add flour and stir frequently with a wooden spoon, 
	being careful not to burn the flour (3-5 minutes). Have the hot water and a whisk close by. When the flour starts to smell 
	like it’s cooking add paprika and stir continuously until fragrant (1 minute). Add 1/2 cup of hot water and whisk vigorously;
	once incorporated, add the next 1/2 cup and continue this process until you have a nice smooth sauce. Add tomato, salt and pepper to taste.
	Bring to the boil and remove from heat.
	</br>
	Pour the sauce over each pepper, being sure that some of the liquid gets into the filling. Pour remaining liquid in casserole dish to submerge
	the potatoes. Cover loosely with tin foil. Place in the oven and cook on a high heat for 45 minutes, peaking a couple times to ensure they don't burn
	(you can turn the casserole dish, as needed, if your oven does not cook evenly).
	</br>
	After 20 minutes take out of the oven, turn each capsicum and the potatoes over and bake for an additional 20-30 minutes. If you find the capsicums 
	are burning too quickly cover loosely with foil for the final 10-20 minutes. Additionally, if the sauce has dried up add a little more of the liquid 
	(if yo find the capsicums are burning too quickly cover loosely with foil for the final 10-20 minutes.
	Additionally, if the sauce has dried up add a little more of the liquid.
